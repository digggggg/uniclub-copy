# University Club Copy 

## This is a for fun Project
I am copying the layout of the University Club of New York's website and recreating it for fun. The goal of this project is to practice Front End Development. I am going to be using CSS and JS for the project. I do not claim any ownership or rights to the website at all. I picked their website because I work as a lifeguard there and I thought it would be fun.
